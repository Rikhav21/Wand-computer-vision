# Wand-computer-vision
This is a project that I made along witha n old wand I made a long time ago with an LED. I thought that it would be cool if I could make it actually "cast" spells, so that was the topic of my CV project.
## How I made it
So first I have a program to extract the path of the spell with find.py, and it saves it under a file. The path is saved as a PNG image that we will later train own model on. I literally just used keras, and I jad around 180 pictures of each path, for the 3 catergories I trained it on. THen I have a demo script which should adjust the screen bightness based on the "spell" that you cast. I was not able to make a webdemo, because I doublt that everyone would have an LED wand lying around, so I hope that the video is enough. https://vimeo.com/1076939763
